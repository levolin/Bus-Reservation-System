The VJ Bus Services program is designed to make booking bus tickets easier. It uses a C language to handle 
all the details of managing bus schedules and passenger bookings. The program works through a simple text 
interface where passengers can choose their bus route, enter their details, and pay securely. It keeps track of 
available seats and lets passengers cancel or change their bookings if needed. After each trip, passengers can 
give feedback on their experience, which helps improve the service. 
Behind the scenes, the program uses special ways of organizing information (like linked lists and stacks) to 
keep everything running smoothly. It also handles errors well, making sure that mistakes in bookings or 
payments don't cause problems. Overall, VJ Bus Services aims to be a reliable and user-friendly tool for 
anyone needing to travel by bus, ensuring a straightforward and secure booking process from start to finish.
